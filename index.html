     <h1>Doge Lives Matter</h1>
     <p class='fon'>Every year a total ammount of animals euthanized due to overcrowding is about 1.5 million.
     Although that number is pretty high it has declined since the year of 2011 in which the annual amount was 2.6 million.
     but no matter how you look at it I disagree with how high the numbers are they're too high.With that being said
     let's talk about some of these dogs and their unique histories
     </p>

       <div class= 'Shibaboi'>
        <h3>Shiba Inu</h3>
        <img src='resources/images/shiba.jpg' width='300' alt='shiba inu'/>
         <p>First breed on our list would be the shiba inu which is an ancient dog breed that's been around as far back as 300 B.C</p>
         <p>It's origins come from japan in which its name refers to it as a hunter as shiba means brushwood either refering to the brush in the mountains
         in japan or of the reddish color of its fur with inu meaning dog</p>
         <p>The first documented shiba to enter the united states was imported by a military family in 1954.
          That being said the breed almost went extinct
          During world war two the shiba nearly disappeared due to a result of food shortages and general chaos after which the original six bloodlines turned into three.</p>

       <h3>Pugs</h3>
       <img src='resources/images/pugjock.jpg' width='300' alt='Charles'/>
       <p>Next up pugs which are believed to have originated from china.
             With that being said they were documented by confucius as early as 551 BC.
             As well with this the chineese emperors considered pugs as prized possessions.
             That and on a side note thier skulls look like someone slammed a door onto their face.</p>

     <div class='Shibaboi'>
       <h3>Chihuahua</h3>
       <img src='resources/images/cpup.jpg' width='300' alt='shiba inu'/>
       <p>Now time for the last dog on our list and probably everyones favorite tiny dog chihuahuas.
          The chihuahua originates from mexico with that being said it's commonly believed that chihuahuas
          are descendents from the Techichi.
            That of which used to be a companion dog favored by the Totlec civilization in mexico.
